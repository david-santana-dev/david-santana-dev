#### Aloe, I'm David Santana 👋

![header banner](img/github-header-banner.png)
I’m a full-stack developer, part-time bug whisperer, and occasional overthinker of variable names. Most of my projects were born from caffeine highs, curiosity dives, long debugging sessions, and a suspiciously high number of visits to Stack Overflow.

I write clean code (or at least code that looks clean after three refactors), and I enjoy building things that actually work—preferably on the first try, but realistically, after a few “why is this not working?!” moments.

If you’re into maintainable software, clever solutions, and occasional commit messages like `fix: it finally works don’t ask me why`, feel free to scroll around or reach out.
Also, if you find a weird bug in one of my repos… congratulations, you’ve just unlocked a bonus feature 🐞✨

Those things definitely weren’t written by AI… unless AI is getting way too good at this.
